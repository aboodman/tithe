Over the past several decades, Open Source has gone from a fringe hippie movement to critical global infrastructure.

We won! Basically all companies are now heavily dependent on Open Source software. And the spoils are rich â€” a vast and deep software commons which enable us to build at a previously unimaginable scale and pace.

Unfortunately, this common infrastructure is also chronically under-funded. You can't make a living maintaining popular and widely used open source packages, so developers typically do it in their spare time.

One result has been a steady drip of major security issues. But more importantly, the best work just isn't getting done. The people suited to tending our digital commons are building better ad targeting (or whatever) to pay the bills.
