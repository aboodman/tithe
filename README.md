# Why

Open Source started out as a fringe movement. But over several decades, it has grown into absolutely critical shared infrastructure. To a close approximation, *all* companies are now heavily dependent upon open source. We won!

However. Open source is also basically unmaintained. The people most capable of doing the maintenance are typically doing so at night and on weekends, while they work something unrelated during the day to make a living.

It‚Äôs time to evolve. We need to direct resources to maintaining our digital commons and allow the right people to do that full-time.

# How

1. Open source maintainers add [tythe.json](./tythe-sample.json) to their repositories. This declares how to send them money in a machine-readable way.
2. Companies take [The Tythe Covenant](./covenant.md) by posting it to social media, or on their website. The Covenant is a public promise to contribute [up to 1%](#how-tythes-are-calculated) of R&D monthly to open source maintenance. Enforcement of the convenant is entirely social.
3. Companies use [go-tythe](#status) (or whatever other tool they want) to automatically distribute and send money to the maintainers of their dependencies every month.

# How Tythes are Calculated

A company's tythe is based on its annualized R&D expenditure. It will never be greater than 1% of this value, and usually significantly smaller.

```
tythe = R&D * 0.01 * tythed_deps / total_deps

R&D:         annualized R&D expenditure
total_deps:  count of transitive dependencies
tythed_deps: count of total_deps that contain a tythe.json
```

## Example 1

 * Your current R&D expenditure: `$2M/yr`
 * Number of transitive dependencies in your tree: `500`
 * Number of transitive dependencies that include `tythe.json`: `150`
 
Your tythe is: `$2M * 0.01 * 150 / 500 = $6000/year` or `$500/month` or `$3.33/mo/dep`

## Example 2

 * Your current R&D expenditure: `$16B/yr`
 * Number of transitive dependencies in your tree: `10k`
 * Number of transitive dependencies that include `tythe.json`: `2k`

Your tythe is: `$16B * 0.01 * 2000 / 10000 = $32M/year` or `$2.7M/month` or about `$1.3k/mo/dep`


# Dividing the Tythe

How a company divides its tythe amongst its dependencies is entirely up to that company. The only requirement from the covenant is the total amount of the tythe, not to where it goes.

By default `go-tythe` will simply divide the tythe evenly amongst all tythed dependencies. However, there will be a user interface to customize the allocations.

# Status

Right now this document is all there is. It‚Äôs in the collecting-feedback stage.

Given interest, I eventually imagine a series of tools that plug into continuous integration that companies can use to calculate and pay tythes automatically.

# FAQ

### Why ‚Äútythe‚Äù not ‚Äútithe‚Äù?
It‚Äôs the archaic spelling. I just like it better.

### Why is the tythe based on R&D, not revenue or profit?
 * Revenue scales too fast in most companies, it ends up being impractical at either the high or low end.
 * R&D scales sub-linear with revenue, making it a nice fit for this use case.
 * Lots of companies have no revenue, but are funded. They should still contribute.
 * R&D in software companies is almost entirely engineers. This makes it easy to compare to the value that open source provides.
 * R&D is already reported publicly in many companies, leading to transparency.
