# Frequently Asked Questions

### What's with the name?

A tithe is a donation that many religious organizations ask of their practicioners, paid to support the clergy and other shared infrastructure of the church. It comes from the old english "tenth", because traditionally it was 10% of one's income.

### Why “tythe” not “tithe”?
It’s the archaic spelling. I just like it better.

### Why 1%?
There should be some amount that is easy for companies to reason about, and this amount should be a widely-understood community expectation.

10% seems unreasonably high, and 1% seems like enough. Companies are welcome to use a larger percentage if they prefer, and we anticipate some social mechanisms that could encourage this.

### Why is the tythe based on R&D, not revenue or profit?

 * Modern companies tend to be extremely scalable. Tiny companies can end up generating billions in revenue. Scaling the tithe by revenue or profit ends up not being sensible at either the top or bottom end of the scale.
 * Lots of software-based companies are pre-revenue or profit, but well-funded. It seems reasonable for them to contribute to the maintenance of their open source dependencies.
 * In tech companies, R&D is basically software engineers. It's easy to think about the relationship between R&D budget and the value that open source software provides.
 * R&D is already publicly reported by many companies. This helps with transparency.

### What prevents companies from cheating?

Their public commitment. Companies are collections of people, many of whom are software developers who would want to support this system. This combined with tools that make tythe status visible internally will ensure quite high compliance among companies that make a public commitment.

### In what sense is this a protocol?

> **protocol** (noun):  
> ...  
> **3a:**: a code prescribing strict adherence to correct etiquette and precedence (as in diplomatic exchange and in the military services)  
> e.g., *a breach of protocol*  
> ...
