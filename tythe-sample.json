// * Redirects - for projects split amongst many repos
// * Multiple addresses here with shares.
// * Other potential types in the future:

//   - paypal (via payout feature)
// * Suggested weights for dependencies -- if a project
//   is very important to my project's functioning, I
//   could suggest a weight which users might figure into
//   calculating shares of the tythe.
